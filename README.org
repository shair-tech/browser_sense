Log information about the browsers accessings your Rails application.

* Installation

BrowserSense monitors which browser is accessing your Ruby on Rails app.

Add the gem to your application's Gemfile and then bundle:

#+begin_example sh
    gem "browser_sense"
#+end_example

#+begin_example sh
   bundle
#+end_example

To enable logging, add =browser_infro= to the =application_controller.rb= of
your app, e.g.:

#+begin_src ruby
  class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
    [...]

    browser_sense

    [...]
  end
#+end_src


* Data logged

Each invocation of a route of your application generates a line in the log storing the
following details:

1. Browser name
2. Platform
3. Device name  
4. Controller being invoked
5. Method of the controller being invoked
6. Request format (e.g. html, json)
7. Hashed IP, which allows to track requests from the same IP, while preserving
   privacy
8. Timestamp

Information is stored in the application log, each line prefixed by
=BrowserSense= and data presented in CSV.

*Example*

#+begin_example bash
  $ cat production.log
  [...]
  BrowserSense: "Firefox","linux","Unknown","Devise::SessionsController","new","12ca17b49af2289436f303e0166030a21e525d266e209267433801a8fd4071a0","2022-06-09T10:08:09+02:00"
  [...]
#+end_example


* Analyzing Data

When you want to analyze data, extract the information with:

#+begin_example
grep BrowserSense production.log | cut -f2- -d: > data.csv
#+end_example

and then, e.g., open the resulting file in a spreadsheet.

There is also a ruby script =browser_sense=. The script takes as input the
pathname of the file with the log and prints to stdout the result of various
analyses.  The script is a quick hack, wrapping =sed=, =grep= and =miller=
([[https://github.com/johnkerl/miller][Miller)]], which must be installed on your machine for the script to succeed.

If you want more reports and plots, you can use the =log_sense= gem
(https://rubygems.org/gems/log_sense), which understands the data generated by
this gem.
        

* Development

After checking out the repo, run =bin/setup= to install dependencies. Then,
run =rake test= to run the tests. You can also run =bin/console= for an
interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run =bundle exec rake
install=. To release a new version, update the version number in =version.rb=,
and then run =bundle exec rake release=, which will create a git tag for the
version, push git commits and the created tag, and push the =.gem= file to
[[https://rubygems.org][rubygems.org]]
